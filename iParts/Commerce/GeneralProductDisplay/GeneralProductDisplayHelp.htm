<p><strong>Formatting Numeric Strings</strong></p>
<p>
           The formatting rules for numeric strings include:
             &nbsp;</p>
<p>
                    # - displays a number, if&nbsp; relevant<br />
                    0 - displays a number or zero placeholder<br />
                </p>
<p>
           For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                20% = <code>0%</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                20.13% = <code>0.00%</code>
            </li>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The Product Code or the Product ID can be passed as a URL parameter.  Use <em>iProductCode</em> for a text 
			string, such as: "MUG" or "WATERBOTTLE". Use <em>iProductID</em> for the GUID product ID, 
			such as &quot;iProductID= 4fe78e06-d0ae-4637-8122-c4e56a92f620&quot;.</li>
            <li>The ID the iPart uses and displays depends on the context:</li>
			   <ul>
                <li>If an <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact is selected, 
                    it loads the <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If no <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact is selected, 
                    it loads the signed in user&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If the user is not signed in, it displays limited information.</li>
                </ul>
			    <li>If a content record contains several dynamic iParts, it is recommended that you turn dynamic page titles off for the entire page in order to limit the title length. </li>
