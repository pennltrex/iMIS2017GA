            <strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item.

            <strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this
            iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.

            <strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Enable this option
            to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor.
            This improves performance during design time (configuration).

            this iPart, which will add a DIV so named around the iPart. Add this CSS class to an appropriate
            style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting to targeted iParts in a reusable way.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Enable this
            option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.

                <strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel minimized by default.

                    <br><i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for

        <li>
            <strong>Limit users who can view data for other contacts</strong> - (enabled by default) If this option is enabled,
            only staff authorized users can view information for contacts other than themselves. This prevents other users from changing the ID in
            the URL to access another contact's data. Authorized users include staff and Group Member Administrators for a group that the contact belongs to.
            Disable this option to allow all users to view information for other contacts, such as for a public profile. If this option is disabled,
            the system security settings determine whether a user must be logged in to view information for other contacts.
        </li>
        <li class="v10only">
            <strong>Restrict invoices by financial entity</strong> - From the drop-down, select a financial entity to filter the open invoices that

            <strong>Display options when no invoices are due</strong> - Select the option for how the iPart

                    <strong>Hide content</strong> - When no invoice is due, the iPart does not display.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Show empty grid with message</strong> - The empty grid displays with the <strong>No open invoice message</strong> displaying in the middle of the grid.
