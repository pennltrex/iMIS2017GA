	<h1>Invoice Payment Link</h1>
		<p>This iPart displays a button for any of the following reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            When the selected contact has unpaid invoices that are due, the button can be configured to display as a "Pay open invoices" option.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the selected contact is a member and is due for membership renewal, the button can be configured to display as a "Renew Now" option, allowing for the member to renew
            their membership directly from their profile page.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the selected contact is a member and is not due for renewal (their membership has not yet expired), but they are eligible to renew their membership in advance. The point in
            time in which they are eligible for renewal is a time specified by you.
        </li>
        <li class="v10only">
            When the selected contact is a non-member or an inactive member, a "Join Now" button can be configured to display so that they may register as a member directly from their
            profile page. Staff users and company administrators can use this button to join as a member on behalf of the contact.

    <li class="v10only"><b>Note for organizations that process renewal billings and use 
        accrual-based accounting</b>: Currently, this iPart can only be used to pay for 
        the most recently billed renewal invoice. Unpaid invoices for previously billed 
        renewal billings cannot be paid with this iPart. This may be an issue if your 
        organization has closely-recurring billing cycles, or if some of your users 
        renew multiple memberships through your organization and those memberships have 
        different billing cycles.</li>
          <li class="v100only">If users have more than one unpaid invoice, all invoices are added to the cart. 
        Users can select which invoices they want to pay from the cart. </li>
