		<h1>Address Selector</h1>
        <p>This iPart displays and changes the specified address of the current contact. It 
            can be added to a content record as a standalone, but is most often used in 
            conjunction with other iParts. </p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

<li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>

<li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>

			    <li>
					<strong>Address path</strong> - (required) Specify 
				    the SOA object for the address you want to display and control through this 
                    iPart.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Cart.ShippingAddress</i> - the shipping address for the current cart.</li>
                        <li><i>Cart.CreditCardAddress</i> - the credit card billing address for the current cart.</li>
                        <li class="v10only"><i>Donation.CreditCardAddress</i> - the credit card billing address for the current donation.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Display button only</strong></li> - (Events only) To minimize the area that the iPart takes up in Event 
                    showcases, this option shows only a graphical button in place of the Address 
                    Selector's title (if any), address, and <u>Choose another address</u> link. The button 
                    opens the selector window. 
                </ul>
		
		
		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
        <li>The <strong>Choose another address</strong> link opens a window that is configured for address verification. 
        Postal addresses entered through this window are automatically uploaded to a service that verifies and standardizes 
        the address. Users can then either accept the suggested address or keep the original, as they entered it.
        </li>
        <li>
          When users select United Kingdom from the <strong>Country</strong> drop-down, a <strong>Postal lookup</strong> field appears, allowing users to 
          search for an address using a postal code. Users can then select the correct address from a list of returned addresses 
          generated by the iMIS address verification service.
        </li>
				<li> You can add this to a content record as a standalone iPart, but it is also 
                    included in other iParts to support address selection. For example,
                    <strong>ShippingMethodSelector</strong> incorporates this iPart and uses the<i> 
                    Cart.ShippingAddress</i> path to display and change the shipping address in the 
                    cart.</li>
			    <li class="v100only"> The <strong>Manage addresses</strong> link displays the <strong>Account Profile</strong> page. The 
			        <strong>Account Profile</strong> page is hardcoded to the content page "@/iMIS/ContactManagement/ContactLayouts/Account_Page". 
			        The URL parameter "AccountPages=Personal" is also passed.</li>
                <li class="v10only"> The <strong>Manage addresses</strong> link displays the <strong>Account Profile</strong> page. The 
                    <strong>Account Profile</strong> page is hardcoded to the content page "@/iCore/Contacts/ContactLayouts/Account_Page". 
                    The URL parameter "AccountPages=Personal" is also passed.</li>
                <li class="v10only"> The <strong>Add a new address</strong> link in the <strong>Choose address</strong> 
                    window allows entry of a new address for this contact. In iPart-based sites, 
                    you can create more than one address with the same <i>custom</i> purpose 
                    (defined in the ADDRESS_PURPOSE table), but multiples 
                are not allowed for the <i>primary</i> purposes (defined in <b>Customer Setup &gt; Address and Notes</b>). If 
                    no custom purposes are defined, and the user has already created an address for 
                    each of the three primary purposes, then the <strong>Add a new address link</strong> 
                    does not display. 
                 </li>
