            </ul>
        </li>
                 <li>
					<strong>Prompt unauthenticated users to sign in </strong> - Enable to generate a label with links to sign 
                    in or create an account. The label appears only if you are an unauthenticated user with items in your cart.</li>
                
				<li>
					<strong>URL for order confirmation </strong> - To use a custom confirmation 
                    page instead of the default confirmation page, enter the URL for the desired 
                    page.</li>
                <li><b>Purpose</b> - This iPart can be used to submit either an 
                    order or a donation for processing. In both cases, use other iParts with this 
                    Submit Order Button Link iPart to complete a transaction. Select a processing 
                    type that best fits your use of this iPart:<ul>
                        <li><b>Cart</b> - The order is submitted for processing from a shopping cart. The 
                            button is labeled <b>Submit Order</b>. </li>
                        <li><b>Donation</b> -<strong> </strong> A donation payment is submitted for processing from a donation 
                            page. The button is labeled <b>Submit Donation</b>. You must also set a 
                            <b>Commit sequence</b> value if this option is selected.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Commit sequence</b> - (required when <b> Purpose</b> = <b>Donation</b>)
                    Commit sequence affects how multiple iParts
                    interact on a page. Enter a non-zero number to specify the order that changes are
                    saved relative to other inline editable iParts on the rendered page. Zero (default)
                    = save order is not important.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
                <li>The Submit Order Payment Link iPart is required when you set up a donation page
                    that processes payments immediately (instead of through the cart). Processing a
                    donation immediately requires that multiple iParts are defined in a single content
                    record. It does not matter the order in which the iParts are defined on the page.
                    In the scenario outlined below, where the Donation Creator is the first iPart displayed
                    on the page and the Submit Order Button Link is the last iPart displayed, the <b>Commit
                        sequence </b>value controls the order in which the iParts are processed. When
                    the donation is &quot;submitted&quot; from the content record, execution control
                    is given to each iPart based on the <b>Commit sequence</b> value shown in parentheses: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Donation Creator (2) </li>
                        <li>Contact Account Creator (1) </li>
                        <li>Submit Order Button Link (3) </li>
                        <li>Payment Creator (4 or 0) </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
			<li>The Cart supports new users by allowing them to create an account using the 
			<b>Account Creator</b> and then complete their order.</li>
			<li>The Cart supports shopping by anonymous users; they are prompted to log in before 
			they can use the <b>Submit Order</b> button.</li>
			<li>The iPart raises a SubmitOrderValidate event to allow other iParts on the page to 
			perform processes on the Cart before it is submitted.</li>
                <li>This iPart uses an application that is external to iMIS.</li>
			</ul>
