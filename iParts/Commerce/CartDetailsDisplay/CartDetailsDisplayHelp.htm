		<h1>Cart Details Display</h1>
        <p>Displays the contents of the shopping cart and allows for quantity changes and 
            deletions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name - </strong>Enter a name for the content item. 
                This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
                <li><strong>Title - </strong>Enter the text to display above this 
                iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>
                <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option 
                to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. 
                This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>
                <li><strong>iPart CSS class - </strong>(optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that 
                    will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate 
                    style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting to targeted 
                    iParts in a reusable way. </li>
                <li><strong>Display a border around this content - </strong>Select 
                this option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>
                <li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel - </strong>Enable 
                to allow users to minimize the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.
                    <ul><li><strong>Show the content as collapsed - </strong>Enable to display the panel minimized by default.<br />
                            <em>Tip: </em>Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> above makes clear what data is hidden from view.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Display on screen sizes (for responsive themes only):</strong><ul>
                    <li><strong>Extra-small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is 
                        hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the 
                        screen is less than 768px.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                        small devices, such as tablets, where the width of the screen is greater than 
                        768px and less than 991px.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on

                        992px and less than 1199px.</li>
                    <li><strong>Large screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                        large devices, such as wide computer monitors, where the width of the screen is 
                        greater than or equal to 1200px wide.
                        <br />
                        <i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for a 
                        page are displayed, regardless of the <strong>Display on screen sizes (for 
                        responsive themes only)</strong> options that are selected.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
			    <li>When an unauthenticated user logs in, the cart item total might increase. This 
                    is because the cart merges the currently selected items with the user&#39;s 
                    pre-existing cart.</li>
			<li>If there is insufficient stock to fill the order, users are prompted to reduce the quantity 
			up to the current maximum. For items that are not available, an out-of-stock message 
                displays.</li>
			<li>Each item&#39;s title is a link to its product details page. This allows users to view
			item details, if configured, and to add more items to the cart.</li>
            <li class="v100only">The ID that the iPart uses and displays depends on the context:<ul>
                <li>If a URL containing a <strong>ContactKey</strong> is provided, it loads that 
                    contact&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If no URL is provided and an <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact is selected, 
                    it loads the <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If no URL is provided and no <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact is selected, 
                    it loads the signed in user&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If the user is not signed in, it displays limited information.</li>
                </ul>
                    </li>
