                    shopping cart or on a donation page. In both cases, use this content item with other

                </li>

                   <ul>
                       <li class="v10only"><i>Exceptions:</i><ul>

            <li><b>Commit sequence</b> - (required when <b>Purpose</b> = <b>Donation</b>)
                    Commit sequence affects how multiple content items interact on a page. Enter a non-zero number 
                    to specify the order that changes are saved relative to other inline editable content items on 
                    the rendered page. Zero (default) = save order is unimportant.</li>
            <li class="v10only"><b>Purchase order number required for Pay Later</b> - (active only if purchase orders are allowed; 
                   enabled by default) 
                Disable this option to allow shoppers to check out using <b>Pay Later</b> without 
                entering a Purchase Order number.</li>
        </ul>
                   
        <p><b>Notes</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Choose another address</strong> link opens a window that is configured for address verification. Postal addresses
          entered through this window are automatically uploaded to a service that verifies and standardizes the address. Users can then either 
          accept the suggested address, or keep the original as they entered it.
         
        </li>
          <li>When users select United Kingdom from the <strong>Country</strong> drop-down, a <strong>Postal lookup</strong> field 
          appears, allowing users to search for an address using a postal code. Users can then select the correct address from a list of returned
          addresses generated by the iMIS address verification service.
        </li>
            <li>Users see the warning &quot;Invalid card number&quot; 
            if their entry fails the check digit algorithm for credit card verification. </li>
            <li>The address is passed to the card authorization gateway and may be used to validate 
                a credit card, depending on 
            the gateway provider. </li>
            <li><b>Donations:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Choosing addresses:</i> For credit and debit donations, the donor&#39;s name and 
                        address are passed to the card authorization gateway and may be used to validate 
                        the card. Only authenticated users see the link to <b>Choose another address</b>. 
                            Unauthenticated users (guests) must enter a valid address in the Contact 
                        Account Creator content item, which is then used to validate the card. </li>
                    <li><i>Commit sequence: </i>A donation page that processes payments immediately 
                (instead of through the cart) must include the Payment Creator. Processing a 
                donation immediately requires the content items to reside on the <em>same</em>
                content record, but they can display in any order. The <b>Commit sequence </b>values, not the placement order, control 
                        when 
                the content items are processed. When the donation is submitted from the content 
                record, execution control is given to each content item based on the <b>Commit sequence</b> 
                value shown in parentheses:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Donation Creator (2) </li>

                            <li>Payment Creator (4 or 0) </li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>

                    <li><i>Choosing addresses</i>: Whether a user may choose another address when entering payment 
                    details depends on which <b>Purpose</b> has been selected:

                            only if the user is logged on. Users who have not logged on must enter a valid

                        submit payment using the PayPal site. If you are designing your own check out pages, 
                        be sure that the <b>Payment Creator</b> and <b>Submit Order Button</b> content items are on the same page. 
                        Note that the PayPal option is hidden whenever the signed-in user is working On
