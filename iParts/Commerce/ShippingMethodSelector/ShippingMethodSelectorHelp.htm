		<h1>Shipping Method Selector</h1>
        <p>The Shipping Method Selector works with the Address Selector content item in order to change the Ship To address. This content item also provides the customer with various shipping method options.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

<li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>

<li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>

			

			</ul>

		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Shipping method options depend on the address to which the item is to be 
                    shipped. If an address is for a country for which no default ship method set has 
                    been indicated, then a message will appear that &#39;You cannot ship to this 
                    country.&#39;</li>
			    <li>The Shipping Method Selector content item uses the Address Selector content item to provide 
			        the functionality for selecting and adding shipping addresses.<br />
			        The <strong>Manage addresses</strong> link on the Address Selector content item displays the <strong>Account Profile</strong> page. 
			    </li>
                <li class="v10only">The <strong>Account Profile</strong> page is hardcoded to the content page "@/iCore/Contacts/ContactLayouts/Account_Page". 
                    The URL parameter "AccountPages=Personal" is also passed.
				</li>
                <li class="v100only">The <strong>Account Profile</strong> page is hardcoded to the content page "@/iMIS/ContactManagement/ContactLayouts/Account_Page". 
                    The URL parameter "AccountPages=Personal" is also passed.
				</li>
                <li>This iPart uses an application that is external to iMIS.</li>
                <li>The Shipping Method Selector does not display when a user is only purchasing items that are not shippable, such as an event registration. <span class="v100only">An item is considered shippable if <strong>Incurs Shipping</strong> is selected on the <strong>Accounting</strong> tab when adding or editing a product on the Staff site.</span><span class="v10only">An item is considered shippable if its <strong>Item Class</strong>, which is selected on the 
                <strong>Summary</strong> tab when adding or editing a product on the Staff site, begins with <strong>SALES-</strong>.</span></li>
