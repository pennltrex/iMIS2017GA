	<h1>Invoice List Display</h1>

    <p class="v10only"><em>Under development for future release</em></p>
    <p class="v100only">The Invoice List Display gives staff users a way to cancel an existing invoice: 
    they can edit a customer's invoice and reverse an item, which generates unapplied credit. 
    The iPart allows editing of a single invoice at a time and does not yet support viewing of 
    canceled invoices or applying of credit, which are under development.</p>
	
	<!-- Use class="v10only" to make a tag visible for iMIS 15 only;
		 Use class="v100only" to make a tag visible for iMIS 100 only;
		 everything else appears common to both products.
