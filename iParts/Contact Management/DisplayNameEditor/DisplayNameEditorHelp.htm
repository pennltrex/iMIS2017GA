    <div class="v10only">  

<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
    <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being

    <li><b>iPart CSS class</b> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that will be 
        applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS 
        class to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special 
        formatting to targeted iParts in a reusable way.</li>
    <li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border around this iPart on 
        the rendered page.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel</strong> - Enable to allow 
        users to minimize the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel minimized by default.
                        <i>Tip</i>: Be sure that the <b>Title</b> makes clear what data is hidden from 
        view.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
    <li><strong>Display on screen sizes (for responsive themes only):</strong><ul>
            <li><strong>Extra-small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is 
                hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the 
                screen is less than 768px.</li>
            <li><strong>Small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                small devices, such as tablets, where the width of the screen is greater than 
                768px and less than 991px.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                medium devices, such as laptops, where the width of the screen is greater than

                greater than or equal to 1200px wide.
            <br><i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for 
                a page are displayed, regardless of the <strong>Display on screen sizes (for 
                responsive themes only)</strong> options that are selected.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    <li class="v10only"><strong> Limit users who can view data for other contacts</strong> - (enabled by default) If this option is enabled, 
            only authorized users can view information for contacts other than themselves. This prevents other users from changing the ID in 
            the URL to access another contact's data. Authorized users include staff and Company Administrators for a group that the contact belongs to. 
            Disable this option to allow all users to view information for other contacts, such as for a public profile. If this option is disabled, 
            the system security settings determine whether a user must be logged in to view information for other contacts.</li>
    <li><b>Commit sequence</b> - Commit sequence affects how multiple iParts interact on 
        a page. Enter a non-zero number to specify the order that changes are saved 
        relative to other inline editable iParts on the rendered page. Zero (default) = 
        save order is not important. </li>
    <li><b>Salutation Type</b> - Select the salutation type you want to be editable.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Anonymous checkbox text</b> - (only available when <b>Donation List As</b> is 
                selected as the Salutation Type) Enter the text prompting users to decide 
                whether or not their donation is marked as anonymous in all reports and 
                acknowledgements. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Label text</b> - Enter the field label text that precedes the name field. For 
        example, <b>List donations as</b> or <b>Formal Name</b>. </li>

    
          
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The salutation types available in this iPart are defined in the <b>
        SALUTATION_CODE</b> table (<b>iMIS Desktop &gt; Customers &gt; Set up tables &gt; General 
        lookup/validation</b>).
            </li>
    <li><i>Donation List As:</i> The <b>Donation List As</b> salutation type has been 
        created specifically to capture the name users want to be listed as in all 
        donation reports and acknowledgements. When the <b>Donation List As</b> type is selected, and a connection has been set up between 
        this iPart and the Donation Creator, then the value entered only applies to that specific 
        donation. When the <b>Donation List As</b> type is selected, and the iPart 
        is <i>not</i> on a donation page, then the value entered is saved for all future 
        donations. <span class="v10only">The <b>Donation List As</b> salutation is synchronized with the <b>
        List As</b> field in <b>iMIS Desktop &gt; Customers &gt; Manage customers &gt; Donor Data</b> 
        detail tab. If you change one field, then the other field is also updated.</span>
            </li>
    <li><i>Using this iPart on a donation page:</i>
        <ul>
            <li>The <i>Display Name Editor </i>is an optional iPart that you can use in 
        donation pages that contain the <i>Donation Creator</i> iPart configured to&nbsp; <b>Process donations immediately</b>. 
                It cannot be connected to the <em>Donation Creator</em> when it is configured for 
                <b>Add
        donation to the cart</b> mode. The content record used for donation pages set up to 
                process donations immediately must contain the following iParts with the <b>Commit sequence</b> value shown
        in parentheses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Donation Creator (2) </li>
                    <li><em>(optional)</em> Display Name Editor (3) </li>
                    <li><em>(optional)</em> Tribute Gift Editor (4)</li>
                    <li>Contact Account Creator (1) </li>
                    <li>Payment Creator (5) </li>
                    <li>Submit Order Button Link (6)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To use this iPart in a donation page, you must create a connection 
                between it and the Donation Creator iPart. <i>To set up the connection</i>: From 
                the <b>Display Name Editor </b>iPart&#39;s title-bar menu, select <b>Connect</b>. Select<b> 
                Create new connection</b>. From the <b>Object Consumer</b> dropdown list, select 
                your <b>Donation Creator</b> iPart. Select <b>Connect</b>, then <b>Save</b> and
                <b>Publish</b> the content record. See the iPart donation section in the 
                Helpsite for further assistance.</li>
