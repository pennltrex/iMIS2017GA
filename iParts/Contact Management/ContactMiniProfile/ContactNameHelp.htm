		<h1>Contact Name</h1>
        <p>This iPart displays and allows editing of the name, title, and company name for a contact record, which can be an individual or a company. This iPart will add the name of the selected contact to the browser window or tab page title when the Use dynamic page titles checkbox is selected on the parent content record. </p>

				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

                <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

                <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being loaded

                    will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate

                <br /><i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes clear what data is hidden from view.</li>

            <br><i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for

            </ul>
        </li>

           <li class="v10only"><strong> Limit users who can view data for other contacts</strong> - (enabled by default) If this option is enabled, 
            only authorized users can view information for contacts other than themselves. This prevents other users from changing the ID in 
            the URL to access another contact's data. Authorized users include staff and Company Administrators for a group that the contact belongs to. 
            Disable this option to allow all users to view information for other contacts, such as for a public profile. If this option is disabled, 
            the system security settings determine whether a user must be logged in to view information for other contacts.</li>

					<strong>Allow editing</strong> - Select this checkbox to enable the 
                    user to edit contact name information (such as Prefix, Name, and Designation) by 
                    clicking an <strong>edit</strong> link on the iPart&#39;s title bar.</li>

                                <li><strong>Allow input/selection of primary organization</strong> - During name editing (if 
                            enabled), this option adds a <strong>Primary Organization</strong> field in which users can add or change 
                            their organization name. After the user types several characters, a dynamic 
                            filter begins presenting the user with possible matching organization records, 
                            to encourage them to link themselves to an existing organization. If none match, 
                            the entered name is saved as plain text.  When a matching organization is selected, the individual contact is added to 
                            the selected organization's roster.
                            <br /> <i>Note: </i>To enable the dynamic filter, the <b>Allow all users to link to an organization</b> option must be selected at <b>Settings > Contacts > General.</b></li>

                            their record.</li>
                                <li><strong>Organization list query path </strong>-  If 
                                    needed, select a custom query for listing appropriate organizations, such as if you have content records specific to different types of users.<ul>
                                        <li><em>Note: </em>If the query is not found (such as when the query name is mistyped), the iPart will display an empty list.  Delete the query
