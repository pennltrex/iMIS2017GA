		<h1>Contact Mini Profile</h1>
    <p>
        This iPart displays the basic contact information for a contact record, which can be an 
        individual or a company. This information can include the name, profile image, company, and member status. This iPart will add its title information, the selected contact's information, to the browser window or tab page title when the <strong>Use dynamic page titles </strong>checkbox is selected on the parent content record.
</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

                    iParts in a reusable way. </li>

                            their organization name. After the user types several characters, a dynamic 
                            filter begins presenting the user with possible matching organization records, 
                            to encourage them to link themselves to an existing organization. If none match, 
                            the entered name is saved as plain text.  When a matching organization is selected, the individual contact is added to 
                            the selected organization's roster.
