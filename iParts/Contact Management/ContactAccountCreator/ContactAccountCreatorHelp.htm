    <p>
        This iPart allows users to create an account for an individual or organization. 
        It can be configured to require only a name and an email in order to create an 
        account. It also has the option to include a name prefix, name suffix, phone, mobile phone, 
        address, and the option to create a logon.</p>
    <ul>

            during design mode (configuration). </li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the

        <li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that 
            will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate

        <li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to 
            display a border around this iPart on the rendered page. </li>

                <li><strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel 
                    minimized by default.

                        hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the 
                        screen is less than 768px.</li>

                        <br />
                        <i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for a 
                        page are displayed, regardless of the <strong>Display on screen sizes (for 
                        responsive themes only)</strong> options that are selected.</li>
                    </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hide for authenticated users</strong> - Enable to display this content item only to unauthenticated users. For example, you could hide the content item from authenticated users when making a donation since they would not need to enter their contact information. Unauthenticated users would be required to enter their contact information.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit sequence</strong> - Allows you to explicitly define the execution
            order of multiple iParts in a content record. The number in this field indicates
            the processing order for this iPart, relative to the other iParts in the same content
            record. The value must be 0 or greater. You can leave the default value of 0 if
            the execution order of iParts is not a concern. iParts with a value of 0 are processed
            <em>after</em> any other iParts with a non-zero <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value
            that are on the same content record. </li>
            </ul>
            
        <p> <strong>Account</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Type of account to create</b> - Sets the type of account that <em>
            authenticated</em> users can create from this iPart (note that unauthenticated 
            users can <em>only</em> create individual accounts):
            <ul>
                <li><b>Individual only </b>- Only individual contacts can be created.</li>
                <li><b>Organization only </b>- Only organization contacts can be created.</li>
                <li><b>Individual or organization </b>- Either individual or organization contacts 
                    can be created.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Assign selected user as administrator for new organizations</strong> - Select this option to automatically assign the logged in user as the administrator for newly created organizations. If a staff user creates the organization, they will have the ability to choose the administrator.</li>
            <li><em>These options apply only when an individual contact is being created:</em>
            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Include primary organization for individuals</strong> - This option adds a <strong>Primary Organization</strong> field in which users can add  
                            their organization name. After the user types several characters, a dynamic 
                            filter begins presenting the user with possible matching organization records, 
                            to encourage them to link themselves to an existing organization. If none match, 
                            the entered name is saved as plain text.  When a matching organization is selected, the individual contact is added to 
                            the selected organization's roster.
                                    <br /> <i>Note: </i>To enable the dynamic filter, the <b>Allow all users to link to an organization</b> option must be selected at <b>Settings > Contacts > General.</b></li>
                                <li><strong>Require primary organization for individuals</strong> - Select this option to force 
                            users to select an existing organization or enter a new one, to be saved with 
                            their record.</li>
                                <li><strong>Organization list query path </strong>-  If 
                                    needed, select a custom query for listing appropriate organizations, such as if you have content records specific to different types of users.
                <ul>
                                        <br /><em>Note: </em>If the query is not found (such as when the query name is mistyped), the iPart will display an empty list.  Delete the query

                                        <br /><em>Note</em>: Any query used with the Contact Account Creator must include <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>Organization</strong> as Display Columns. Please see the default query

        accept the suggested address or keep the original, as they entered it.</li>
    <li>The selected default country in iMIS (i.e., SystemDefaultCountry) is used as the default country in the Contact Account Creator.<div class="v10only">To change the default country in iMIS, in the iMIS staff site, navigate to <strong>Settings > Contacts > General</strong> and select an option from the <strong>Set the default country</strong> drop-down list.</div><div class="v100only">To change the default country in iMIS, in the iMIS staff site, navigate to <strong>Settings > Finance > General</strong> and select an option from the <strong>Default country</strong> drop-down list.

    <li class="v10only">When adding this iPart to a content record, keep the following notes in mind:
        <ul>
            <li>To use this iPart, you must enable the <b>Auto Assign Member Number </b>option from 
                Customers setup window for<b> Basic Options</b>.</li>
            <li>The address purposes available in this iPart are based on the <b>ADDRESS_PURPOSE
                </b>table defined Customers table setup for <b>General lookup/validation</b>. </li>
            <li>You can select the default <b>Customer Type </b>to use for new contacts created in this 
                iPart from <b>Settings &gt; Organization</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="v100only">When adding this iPart to a content record, keep the following notes in mind:
        <ul>
            <li>Configuration of the password policy for the application is specified in the
                <b>&lt;system.web&gt;&lt;membership&gt;</b> section in the <b>web.config</b> file. </li>

        <li class="v10only">The Contact Account Creator is required when you set up a donation page
            that processes payments immediately (instead of through the cart). Processing a
            donation immediately requires that multiple iParts are defined in a single content
            record. It does not matter the order in which the iParts are defined on the page.
            In the scenario outlined below, where the Donation Creator is the first iPart displayed
            on the page and the Submit Order Button Link is the last iPart displayed, the <b>Commit
                sequence </b>value controls the order in which the iParts are processed. When
            the donation is &quot;submitted&quot; from the content record, execution control
            is given to each iPart based on the <b>Commit sequence</b> value shown in parentheses:
            <ul>
                <li>Donation Creator (2) </li>
                <li>Contact Account Creator (1) </li>
