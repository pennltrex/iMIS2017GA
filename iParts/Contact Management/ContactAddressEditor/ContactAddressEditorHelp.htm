		<h1>Contact Address Editor</h1>
        <p>The Contact Address Editor displays addresses in individual tabs and allows contacts to add new addresses or edit existing ones. It also has a configuration option that allows you to use the Address Mapper content item to display a &quot;show map&quot; link underneath the address. This link will enable users to click and see the location in a Google Maps popup window. </p>

      <li>Address Verification:</li>
      <ul>
			<li> 
				Postal addresses entered through this iPart are automatically uploaded to 
                a service that verifies and standardizes the address. Users can then either 
                accept the suggested address or keep the original, as they entered it.</li>
        <li>When users select United Kingdom from the <strong>Country</strong> drop-down, a <strong>Postal lookup</strong> field 
        appears, allowing users to search for an address using a postal code. Users can then select the correct address from a list 
        of returned addresses generated by the iMIS address verification service.
      </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      
                <li class="v100 only">If there is only one address for a contact, the <strong>Preferred Billing Address</strong>, 
                    <strong>Preferred Shipping Address</strong>, and <strong>Preferred Mailing Address</strong> flags are hidden.  
            When more than one address is in the system for a user, then these flags are available for 
            selection when editing an address. </li>
            <li class="v10 only">The following conditions can determine if the <strong>Preferred Billing Address</strong>, 
                <strong>Preferred Shipping Address</strong>, and <strong>Preferred Mailing Address</strong> flags are displayed:

				When creating a new address, users can select what type of address they are 
                creating. The <b>Purpose</b> dropdown list includes the three <i>primary</i> address 
                types set up in <b>Customers &gt; Set up module &gt; General &gt; 
                Address and Notes</b> and any additional <i>custom</i> address types created from the <b>
                ADDRESS_PURPOSE</b> general lookup/validation table. Note that users can only 
                select the <b>Preferred</b> address options (<b>Mailing</b>, <b>Shipping</b>, <b>
                Billing</b>) for the three <i>primary</i> address types.&nbsp; 
                Additionally, in iPart-based sites, you can create more than one address with 
                the same <i>custom</i> purpose, but multiples 
                are not allowed for the <i>primary</i> purposes.&nbsp; 
                In the Public view and the Web view (non iParts-based sites), users will only be

				A <b>Status</b> field is displayed in the iPart if you have set up values in the
                <b>BAD_ADDRESS</b> validation table. This allows you to mark addresses with

            <li class="v10only"> 
				In the Mini Profile iPart, users can define default values for Informal Name, Title, 
                and Organization. However, these values can be overridden for a particular address by adding new values from the Contact 
                Address Editor. If the Contact Address Editor fields are left blank, then the 
                default value is used.</li>
