	<h1>Related Items</h1>
    <p>The Related Items iPart displays a list of images based on the results of an IQA query. 
    For example, you can write a query to display the profile pictures of everyone who has registered for an event, 
    or to display products in the same category.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. 
			This text only appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

			<li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this 
			iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

			<li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Enable this option

			This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>

			<li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that 
        will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS 
        class to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special 
        formatting to targeted iParts in a reusable way.</li>
            <li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Enable this 
			option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>

                    <i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes clear what data is hidden
                    from view.</li>
            </ul>             

            <li><strong>Display on screen sizes (for responsive themes only):</strong><ul>

                hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the 
                screen is less than 768px.</li>

            <br><i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for 
                a page are displayed, regardless of the <strong>Display on screen sizes (for 
                responsive themes only)</strong> options that are selected.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <li><strong>Source query</strong> - Click <strong>select</strong> and browse to the IQA query that 
            you want to see results for in the list.</li>

            <li><strong>Maximum results</strong> - Enter the total number of results to be 
                displayed. </li>
            
            <li><strong>Description</strong> - If you want a description to be displayed below the title and above
            the list, enter the text for the description here. The variable {0} can be used in the description to display
            the total record count number. For example, <i>{0} people also bought this product.</i></li>	

            <li><strong>No results found message</strong> - Message displayed if no results are returned. 
                If this field is blank, no message is displayed to the user when there are no results.</li>
            
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Filter Options</b></p>
        You can dynamically filter the query results 
    based on the value of a particular property.
        If a <b>Filter column</b> is selected, the iPart looks for a URL parameter to set the value for that property. 
        The name of the URL parameter is defined in the <b>Filter on URL parameter</b> field. 
    For example, to filter the query to show only the category passed in the URL 
    (for example <i>Category=GIFTS</i>), choose the <i>ProductCategory</i> column and specify <i>Category</i> as the URL parameter.
    <ul>
            <li><strong>Filter column</strong> - Select a data column to filter the query 
                results on. <i>Note: </i>Each property you select on the <b>Display</b> tab 
                of your query in IQA is available as a <b>Filter column</b> option. </li>            		
            
            <li><strong>Filter on URL parameter</strong> - Enter the URL parameter name by which you want to 
                filter values. You can use an existing URL parameter, for example <i>Category</i>, 
                or you can enter a unique value.</li>
            
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Display Options</b></p>
    <ul>           
            
            <li><strong>Item image file path</strong> - Enter the file path where item images 
                are located, or leave blank to use the default path. If the source query has a 
                column with an alias of <i>Image</i>, then that value is used for the 
                image file name, and the default path (if not specified in the query) is <i>/images/ImageLibrary</i>. If there 
                is no <i>Image</i> column in the source query, then the default path is 
                <i>/images/Profile</i>. In this case, the iPart will attempt to locate a profile 
                picture based on the ID for each result.</li>  
			
            <li><strong>Default item image</strong> - Enter the file name for the image to display when a query result has no image. 
                Include the file path if it is different than the default path or the path 
                specified in <strong>Item image file path</strong>. Example: 
                <em>/images/MySite/default_product.jpg</em>.</li>

            <li><strong>Item image size</strong> - Choose a size for the images that are displayed for the query results.</li>

        <li><strong>List orientation</strong> - Choose whether to display the list of results horizontally or vertically.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enable horizontal scrolling</strong> - If the <strong>List orientation</strong> is Horizontal, select this option to 
                display the results in a scrollable list. If this option is enabled, the Tooltip 
                option is not available for <strong>Display item name as.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Scroll width</strong> - If <strong>Enable horizontal scrolling</strong> is enabled, enter the number of pixels for the 
                width of the scrollable list. A value of 0 sets the width to 100% of the column where the iPart is placed.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Display item name as</strong> - Choose whether to display the name of each result as a tooltip when the user 
            hovers over the image or as a label which appears below the image. The source query 
                must include a column with an alias of <i>Name</i> in order to display an 
                item name.</li>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Label length</strong> - If displaying the item name as a label, choose the number of characters to display in the label. 
                Names longer than this will be truncated.</li>                     
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Items link to (URL or shortcut)</strong> - The URL or shortcut used when the image is clicked. 
            If blank, the image is not clickable. The URL may be relative to 
                the website root; for example the link to <i>
                http://www.yoursite.com/Member/iMIS/ContactManagement/ContactLayouts/Account_Page.aspx</i> 
                can be entered as <i>
                Member/iMIS/ContactManagement/ContactLayouts/Account_Page.aspx</i>. 
            URL parameters may be added to the URL or shortcut. To dynamically add the value of an item property, 
            you can include the property or column name as a variable by enclosing it in {}. For example, to include a 
            product ID in the URL where the column name for product ID is <i>key_Id</i>, you can append <i>?iProductID={key_Id}</i> 
                to the URL. For queries that return contacts, the ID value
            of the contact is automatically appended to the URL.  </li>
