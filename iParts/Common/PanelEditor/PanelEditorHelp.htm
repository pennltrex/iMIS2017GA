    <h1>Panel Editor</h1>
    <p>
        Panel Editor lets you display contact user-defined data for users to view and
        edit custom. You can add fields from User-Defined Fields (UDF) as well as
        existing tables already defined in Customizer.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being
            loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that
            will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS
            class to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special
            formatting to targeted iParts in a reusable way.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - (required for
            collapsible panels) Select this option to display a border around this iPart
            on the rendered page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Display content within a collapsible panel</strong> - Enable to allow
            users to minimize the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.<ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel
                    minimized by default. <br /><i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes
                    clear what data is hidden from view.

                <br />
                Tip:
            </em> You do not have to republish the iPart to see panel changes; panels are stored separately from content records.

            <h3>(New panel) options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Panel name</strong> - Identify the panel for administrators; it does not appear on the displayed page.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Panel description</strong> - (optional) Explain the panel for administrators;  it does not appear on
                    the displayed page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Show data sources...</strong> <em>radio buttons</em> - Specify whether you want to populate the panel
                    from single-instance (simple) tables, which is the default, or a multi-instance table. If you need data from a
                    multi-instance table, you must place it in a separate panel: a panel can only display a single multi-instance table at a time, by itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>[<u>+</u>] [<u>-</u>]</strong> <i>far right</i> - (optional) Add/remove columns. Click the
                    plus-sign button to the right of the layout area to add up to two more columns. If the right-most column is empty
                    when you select <strong>OK</strong>, it is removed from the layout.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Layout area</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Label:</strong> Edit the default text for each field, to make it shorter or more user-friendly.
                    <br />
                    <i>Labeling is required:</i> If you delete the default label, the iPart uses the
                    underlying column name
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Read-only</strong>: Enable on those fields for which you want to prevent user updates. This option
                    only applies if you have enabled <strong>Allow users to edit</strong> or <strong>Allow users to add</strong> (below).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Required</strong>: Enable on those fields for which you require
                    completion of a field (such as providing data) or have a required action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hide in Summary View</strong>: Enable on non-critical fields that you want to make available only
                    in the full pop-up view.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Double-clicking adds a field to the first available space in your panel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dragging a field lets you place it elsewhere in the panel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add one field by double-clicking, dragging, or clicking on the plus icon <strong>[+]</strong>
                    to the left of each node in the hierarchy. Each node is an available table, and its fields
                    expand below it. If you see no plus icon, all of its available fields are already added to your panel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a whole table by dragging or double-clicking a table name; if you have already added
                    fields from that table, the remaining fields will be added without duplication. Fields appear in the
                    first available space in your panel, until the space is used up.
                </li>
                <li>Add fields from <em>different</em> nodes to combine fields from different single-instance tables.</li>

                <li>
                    Arrange fields by dragging within the layout preview area. Leave empty cells where you want white
                    space to appear within the panel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove field: Click the <strong>X</strong> button after its name; it returns to the
                    hierarchical control, from which you can select it again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove column: Click the <strong>[<u>-</u>]</strong> button to the right of the layout area;
                    it removes the right-most column.
                </li>

            the URL to access another contact's data. Authorized users include staff and Company Administrators for a group that the contact belongs to.
            Disable this option to allow all users to view information for other contacts, such as for a public profile. If this option is disabled,

If Panel Editor is configured to open in edit mode by default, an option to set a commit sequence also displays:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Commit Sequence</strong> - Allows you to explicitly define the execution order of multiple content items in a content record. The number in this field indicates the processing order for this content item, relative to the other content items in the same content record. The value must be 0 or greater. You can leave the default value of 0 if the execution order of content items is not a concern. Content items with a value of 0 are processed <em>after</em> any other content items with a non-zero <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value that are on the same content record.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <em>Note:</em> <strong>Open single-instance panels in edit mode by default</strong> only displays as a configuration option when a single-instance panel is selected.

                    You can connect panel-displaying iParts on the same content record so that they

                <li>
                    New fields added to User-defined tables in Customizer will not display as

        When you create a new panel data source through Panel Designer, the new data source displays as a business object
        in the Business Object Designer. A <strong>ContactKey</strong> is automatically generated for the business object. The <strong>ContactKey</strong> is a
        unique value used to join the business object that represents the panel data source to other panel data sources and
        business objects in IQA. It is also used as the <strong>iMIS ID</strong> for linking in IQA.
