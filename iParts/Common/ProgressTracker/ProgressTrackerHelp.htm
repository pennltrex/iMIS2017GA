            <strong>Source query</strong> - Click <strong>select</strong> and browse to the IQA query that
            you want to see results for in the Progress Tracker. The query must contain specific aliases:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal_Amount: </strong>Indicates which property is the goal amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Sum_Total: </strong>Indicates which property is the amount to be summed.</li>
                <li><strong>End_Date: </strong>Indicates which property specifies the end date. This alias is only required if you want to display an end date.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Filter Options</b></p>
        This section can be used if you want to dynamically filter the query results 
    based on the value of a particular property.
        When you choose a data column to filter on, iMIS looks for a URL parameter to set the value for that property. 
        The URL parameter it looks for is the one specified in the <b>URL parameter</b> field. 
    For example, to filter the query to show only the item ID passed in the URL, 
    choose the query column for the item ID and specify <i>ItemId</i> as the URL parameter.
    <ul>
            <li><strong>Filter on data column</strong> - Select a data column to filter the query results on. 
            <i>Note: </i>Each property you select on the <b>Display</b> tab 
                of your query in IQA is available as a <b>Filter on data column</b> option. </li>            		
            
            <li><strong>URL parameter</strong> - If you choose a data column to filter 
                the query on, enter the parameter name by which you want to 
                filter values. You can use an existing URL parameter, for example <i>ItemId</i> 
                (which the Donation Creator iPart also 
                uses), or you can enter a unique value.</li>
            
        </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Display Messages</b></p>
    <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong> - If you want to display a description below the Progress Tracker, enter the text for the description here. The variables 
                below can be used in the description. For example, &quot;Help us reach our goal of 
                [GoalTotal] new members by [EndDateLong]&quot;<ul>
                    <li>[GoalTotal] displays the goal total<br/></li>
                    <li>[CurrentTotal] displays the current sum total or count<br/></li>

                </ul>
