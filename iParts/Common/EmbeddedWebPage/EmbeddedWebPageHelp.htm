		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during
            design mode (configuration).</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered
            page. If blank, no title displays. The title may contain data placeholders which
            will be resolved against the data sources e.g. if the iPart is showing details of
            an Event, the Event name could be shown within the title.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content
            record data from being loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during
            design time (configuration).</li>
        <li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class to associate
            with this iPart, which will add a DIV so named around the iPart. Add this CSS class
            to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting
            to targeted iParts in a reusable way.</li>
        <li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display
            a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>
        <li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel</strong> - Enable to allow users
            to minimize the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel minimized
                by default.
                <br />
