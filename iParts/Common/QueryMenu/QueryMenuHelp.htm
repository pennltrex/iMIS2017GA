    <h1>
        Query Menu</h1>
    <p>
        This iPart displays a query, set with whatever title, parameters,
        columns, labels, and sorting you need. It allows for exports, which adds icons
        for sending the data to Word, Excel, PDF, and CSV. You can also organize helpful
        queries into a folder and point the iPart to that folder. When the page loads, the
        iPart displays the first query at the top of that folder, and it presents a drop-down
        menu of additional queries available, organizing them by subfolders, if any. When
        the user clicks on a query from the menu, the iPart immediately runs that query
        and displays the results.</p>

            <strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered
            page. If blank, no title displays. The title may contain data placeholders which

            an Event, the Event name could be shown within the title.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content

            to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting
            to targeted iParts in a reusable way.
