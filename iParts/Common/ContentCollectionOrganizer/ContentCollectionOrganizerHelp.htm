                        <br />This is the target of the navigation link. You can specify an absolute URL to any website, a relative URL to pages within the website associated with this sitemap, or you can click <strong>select</strong> to browse for a content record. For relative URLs, use a tilde character to represent the IIS web site root where this sitemap’s website is located.

For example, select this option if you link to a contact profile page and would like to display the newly created contact's profile.</li>
            <i>Note:</i> On the last step in the wizard, a <strong>Finish</strong> button will be added instead of a <strong>Next</strong> button.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click + to add a tab/step.</li>
        <li><strong>Move left</strong> - Click to move the selected tab/step to the left 
            (changes display/process order).</li>
        <li><strong>Move right</strong> - Click to move the selected tab/step to the right 
            (changes display/process order).</li>

            to display, keep in mind that access to content records can be limited by 
            security. To prevent errors, make sure that the content records you select can 
            be accessed by the intended users. <i>Access Settings</i> are defined when 
            editing a content record from <i>Page Builder &gt; Manage content</i>.<ul>
                <li>Click <strong>Preview</strong> to check the data to be displayed. </li>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Hide this step</strong> - (available if Function as wizard
                    option is selected) Select this option to hide the step to the user (does not display). 
                This allows you to attach any action content items without user intervention. For 
                example, you might want to send an email message when a certain step is 
                complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Next step on success - </strong>(available if <strong>Function as wizard
                    </strong>option is selected and <strong>Steps must be sequential</strong> option is 
                    <i>not</i> selected) 
                Select the step to display if the current step is successful.</li>
        <li><strong>Next step on failure</strong> - (available if <strong>Function as wizard 
                    </strong>option is selected and <strong>Steps must be sequential</strong> option is 
                    <i>not</i> 
                selected) Select the step to display if the current step fails. <strong>Default</strong> causes the wizard to remain on the current step..</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When displaying multiple Content Collection Organizer (CCO) content items on a single web page, you must configure each
            CCO content item to have a unique <strong>Name.</strong></li>
        <li>You can create links to specific tabs of your CCO
            content item using URL parameters. The parameter is either passed through from the webpage&#39;s
            navigation item or from a direct link to the page, and it can be built using either
            the tab name or tab index. The available URL parameters are <strong>[ContentItem Name]=[Tab name]</strong>
            and <strong>[ContentItem Name]=[tab index]</strong>. For example, if you want to create a link directly
            to the <strong>Giving History</strong> tab of your <strong>Account Pages</strong> CCO content item, set the URL to <strong>http://mywebsite.com/Account_Page.aspx?Account_Pages=Giving
            History</strong>. Or, if you want to attach that same parameter to the navigation item instead,
            enter <strong>Account_Pages=Giving History</strong> into the navigation item&#39;s <strong>URL Parameters</strong> field.
            You also have the option to link by the tab index. For example, if the <strong>Giving History</strong>
            tab is the second tab displayed, use <strong>Account_Pages=2</strong>.
            <p>
                When creating a link to a tab, keep the following guidelines in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the content item <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Tab name</strong> defined within the configuration page of your CCO content item.</li>
                <li>Replace any spaces in the content item <strong>Name</strong> with underscores.</li>
                <li>Enter the exact <strong>Tab name</strong>, including spaces.</li>
                <li>Direct tab linking does not work when the option <strong>Function as wizard</strong> is enabled.</li>
                <li>If you change the content item <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Tab name</strong>, or tab order, you may need to update any
                    navigation items or links that point to that tab.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
