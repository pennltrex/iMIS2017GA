    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
        <p>
            This iPart should be placed on its own on a content page. It will take full control of the content page and redirect to a specific page which hosts the RDP control. No other iParts will be displayed. Although not essential it is generally advisable to configure a navigation link to open the content page in a new window.</p>
        <p>
            Only Full and Casual users will be able to access to use this facility, all other users will see &quot;Access denied&quot;.</p>
        <p>
&nbsp;The page hosting the RDP control will contain the connection details for the terminal server. Some consideration should therefore be given to security. The page will use the same transport protocol as the content page containing the iPart i.e. if the content page is opened using https then the page hosting the control will also use https. Public and Guest users will never have access to the connection details.</p>
        <p>
            The terminal server must be specifically configured to allow the Advanced Accounting Console to be remotely launched. </p>
        <p>
            The Advanced Accounting Console installed on the terminal server must be preconfigured to connect to the same iMIS application server as the website. This connection information is not passed through from the website.</p>
