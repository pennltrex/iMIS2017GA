                If blank, no title displays.</li>
                <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content

                    will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate

                <li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border 
                around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>

                the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.<ul>

                            <br /><i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes clear what data is hidden from view.</li>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Display on screen sizes (for responsive themes only):</strong><ul>
            <li><strong>Extra-small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is 
                hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the 
                screen is less than 768px.</li>
            <li><strong>Small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                small devices, such as tablets, where the width of the screen is greater than 
                768px and less than 991px.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                medium devices, such as laptops, where the width of the screen is greater than

            <li><strong>Large screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                large devices, such as wide computer monitors, where the width of the screen is 
                greater than or equal to 1200px wide.
            <br><i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for 
                a page are displayed, regardless of the <strong>Display on screen sizes (for 
                responsive themes only)</strong> options that are selected.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><li>
					<strong>Event key</strong> - (optional) The key of the specific event to edit. 
					This comes from the <strong>Event.EventKey</strong> column. 
                    The key may also be supplied via the URL.
                    A key specified in the iPart configuration takes precedence over a key in the 
                    URL.
                    If no key is specified, the iPart opens in Add mode, for creation of a new event.
				</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li> 
					If a key value is not set in the configuration page, the iPart looks for the key 
                    in the URL. To include the key in the URL, use the parameter name EventKey, such as
					<span class="v10only"><b>?EventKey=SPR12</b></span>
                    <span class="v100only"><b>?EventKey=72290518-44B9-428B-909D-10142B4B6B9F</b></span>.
                    A key specified in the iPart configuration takes precedence over a key in the 
                    URL.</li>
            </ul>
