    The following variables can be used to display information for the selected 
    contact: [FirstName], [FullName], [OrgName].</li>

<li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>
<li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class to associate with this iPart. This will add a DIV of the same name around the iPart. Add this CSS class to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting to targeted iParts in a reusable way.</li>
<li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>
<li class="v10only"><strong>Display on screen sizes (for responsive themes only):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Extra-small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the screen is less than 768px.</li>
<li><strong>Small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on small devices, such as tablets, where the width of the screen is greater than 768px and less than 991px.</li>
<li><strong>Medium screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on medium devices, such as laptops, where the width of the screen is greater than 992px and less than 1199px.</li>

<li><strong>Hide if user is not the selected contact</strong> - (enabled by default) If this option is enabled, non-authorized 
                            users will only see this iPart if they are viewing their own information. Authorized users include staff and 
                           <span class="v10only"> Company Administrators </span> <span class="v100only">Group Member Administrators </span> for a group that the contact belongs to. If a different 
                            contact is selected, the iPart will be hidden. This prevents other users from changing the ID in the URL to access 
                            another contact's data. Disable this option to allow all users to view the iPart for other contacts, such as for a public profile. 
                            If this option is disabled, the system security settings determine whether a user must be logged in to view the iPart for other contacts.</li>

                                information. If you want users to have easy access to both the account pages and

                        </ul>
                <li><b>Is the page context (parent) for this iPart a group?</b> Choose <b>Yes</b> 
                        if the context for this iPart is a specific group, and you wish to display its 
                        group members and sub-groups. Choose <b>No</b> for any other type of 
                        context.
                        <span class="v100only">For example, choose <b>Yes</b>
                        to display all members of a chapter and any committee groups within that 
                        chapter.</span>
                    <li><b>URL parameter for parent ID </b>- Leave this field blank, unless you want to 
                        change which URL parameter the iPart uses for a parent ID value. By default, the iPart looks for a <b>UniformKey</b> 
                        or <b>iUniformKey</b> parameter value. If neither is available, the iPart uses the 
                        selected or signed-in user as the <b>parent ID</b>.</li>

                            <li><b>Groups owned by the parent ID and their members</b> - Select this option to display a list of groups owned by a 
                                particular parent ID, and the members of those groups. If multiple groups are owned by the parent ID, initially 
                                only the groups are listed, but each group can be expanded to display 
                                members. If only a single group is owned by the parent ID, initially all of the 
                                group members are listed. For example, if you add the Group List Editor to an 
                                organization contact&#39;s account page (and choose the relevant group type), it will automatically display an organization roster 
                                (a group member list).
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Groups that the parent ID is member of</b> - Select this option to display a list of groups that the parent ID belongs to (memberships).
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Both of the above (use this option to display two-way relationships)</b> - Select this option to 
                            display both groups (and group members) that the parent ID owns AND groups that the parent ID belongs to. This option should be used to 
                            display relationships between two entities.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <i>Note:</i> The <b>Display a list of</b> section displays only when the page context (parent) for this iPart is not a group.</li>
                     </li>
                     <li class="v100only"><b>Automatically create a group if one does not exist</b> - Select this option to allow users to add members to a group 
                      even if a group of that type does not already exist. This option is only available if <b>Allow editing</b> is enabled and <b>Groups that the 
                      parent ID is a member of</b> is NOT selected.
                      For example, you can choose to only display a chapter&#39;s committees. If no committees exist yet, no groups are listed, 
                      but a user can click the add link to automatically create a committee and add members. 
                      Select this mode if you want to display an organization roster, so that the organization group can be auto-created when you add the first member. 
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Group owner type</b> - Select the type of owner for the group that will be created automatically. Depending on how your 
                            system is set up, the available owner types can include broad categories such as Events, Contacts, Groups, and Public. </li>
                            <li><b>Group type to auto-create</b> - Select the type of group which will be created automatically when users add members. When you 
                            select a group type for this option, it is automatically added to the list of group types to include.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>                                                                    				
				    <li><b>Choose the group types to include</b> - Select the group types you wish to include in the list of groups, sub-groups, and/or group memberships. 
                    For example, if a chapter has both committee and club sub-groups, you can select one or both to be displayed within the iPart. If you wish to display 
                    a contact's memberships in organizations, committees, and chapters, you can choose all of these group types.</li>
                    </ul>
			
			
		
		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A good use for this iPart is to add it to a page that already displays 
                    information about a contact, event, or some other type of group page. In most 
                    cases, the Group List Editor will detect the group, parent, or contact ID in the 
                    URL and display a group list in the mode you select. If you add the iPart to a 
                    group page, and a group list does not display as you would expect, check the URL 
                    of the web page to determine if it uses a URL parameter other than <b>UniformKey</b> or 
                    <b>iUniformKey</b>. 
                </li>
                <li class="v100only"> 
					You can create, edit, and delete group types, roles, and statuses 
                    from <b>Tools &gt; Setup &gt; Groups</b>. A group type that represents a two-way relationship can be defined as a Relationship Group.</li>
                <li> 
					                    You can hard code URL parameter values using a 
                    navigation item. From <b>Site Builder &gt; Manage sitemaps</b>, create or edit a 
                    navigation item and in the <b>URL Parameters</b> field, enter a parameter name and 
                    value. For example, ID=123.</li>
