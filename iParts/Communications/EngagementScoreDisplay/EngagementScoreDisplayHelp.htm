            <strong> Limit users who can view data for other contacts</strong> - (enabled by default) If this option is enabled,
            only authorized users can view information for contacts other than themselves. This prevents other users from changing the ID in
            the URL to access another contact's data. Authorized users include staff and Company Administrators for a group that the contact belongs to.
            Disable this option to allow all users to view information for other contacts, such as for a public profile. If this option is disabled,
            the system security settings determine whether a user must be logged in to view information for other contacts.
