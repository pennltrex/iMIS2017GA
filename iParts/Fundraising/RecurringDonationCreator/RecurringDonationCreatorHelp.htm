	<p> The Recurring Donation Creator content item provides donors with the opportunity to elect to make their one time donation recur over time. The setup options allow users to choose the frequency of their donations: Monthly, quarterly or annually.</p>   
           <ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. 
			This text only appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

			<li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this 
			    content item on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

			<li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Enable this option 
			to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. 
			This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>
		<li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class to associate with 
		this content item, which will add a DIV so named around the content item. Add this CSS class to an appropriate 
		style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting to targeted content items in a reusable way.</li>
		<li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border 
		around this content item on the rendered page.</li>
		<li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel</strong> - Enable to allow users to minimize 
		the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.</li>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel minimized by default. 
			<br /><i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes clear what data is hidden from view.</li>
		</ul>

		       <li><strong>Display on screen sizes (for responsive themes only):</strong><ul>
            <li><strong>Extra-small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is 
                hidden on extra small devices, such as smartphones, where the width of the 
                screen is less than 768px.</li>
            <li><strong>Small screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                small devices, such as tablets, where the width of the screen is greater than 
                768px and less than 991px.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                medium devices, such as laptops, where the width of the screen is greater than 
                992px and less than 1199px.</li>
            <li><strong>Large screens</strong> - When disabled, this content item is hidden on 
                large devices, such as wide computer monitors, where the width of the screen is 
                greater than or equal to 1200px wide.
            <br><i>Note: </i>When <strong>Easy Edit</strong> is enabled, all content items for 
                a page are displayed, regardless of the <strong>Display on screen sizes (for 
                responsive themes only)</strong> options that are selected.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

		       <li><strong>Commit Sequence -</strong> Allows you to explicitly define the execution order of multiple content items in a content record. The number in this field indicates the processing order for this content item, relative to the other content items in the same content record. The value must be <strong>0</strong> or greater. You can leave the default value of <strong>0</strong> if the execution order of content items is not a concern. Content items with a value of <strong>0</strong> are processed after any other content items with a non-zero <strong>Commit Sequence</strong> value that are on the same content record. </li>
               <br>For example, processing a donation immediately requires that multiple content items are defined in a single content record. It does not matter the order in which the content items are defined on the page. In the scenario outlined below, where the Recurring Donation Creator is the first content item displayed on the page and the Submit Order Button Link is the last content item displayed, the <strong>Commit Sequence</strong> value controls the order in which the content items are processed. When the donation is submitted from the content record, execution control is given to each content item based on the <strong>Commit Sequence</strong> value shown in parentheses:<ul>
                       <li>Donation Creator (<strong>2</strong>)<li>Recurring Donation Creator (<strong>3</strong>)<li>Contact Account Creator (<strong>1</strong>)<li>Payment Creator (<strong>5</strong>)<li>Submit Order Button Link (<strong>6</strong>)</br>
                   </ul>
               <li><strong>Recurring gift frequency:</strong><ul>
                   <li><strong>Allow user to specify frequency</strong> - Allows donors to determine the frequency with which their gifts renew.<br /><em>Note:</em> This option should not be used if payment terms are offered for the donation.<ul>
                       <li><strong>&#39;No&#39; radio option text</strong> - Enter the text to display next to the<strong> No</strong> option. This button prevents a recurring donation.</li>
                       <li><strong>&#39;Yes&#39; radio option text</strong> - Enter the text to display next to the<strong> Yes</strong> option. This button creates a recurring donation instruction.</li>
                       <li><strong>Gift frequency text</strong> - Enter the text to display next to the gift frequency drop-down.</li>
                       </ul>
                   </li>
                   <li><strong>Fixed annual frequency</strong> - Sets any gift entered on this page to renew annually.<br /><em>Note:</em> The Recurring Donation Creator content item will not be displayed when this option is selected. Other text on the content page should clearly indicate to the donor that their gift will automatically renew each year until they choose to stop it.</li>
                   </ul>
               </li>
               		    </ul>
