		    -->This content item enables users to add a gift (donation) to the cart. The content item defaults to a single, empty Gift Amount field, but can be pre-populated or set to show a range of suggested gift amounts. This content item will add its title information, typically the name of the donation item, to the browser window or tab page title when the <strong>Use dynamic page titles</strong> checkbox is selected on the parent content record.

<li><strong>Processing mode</strong> - Donations made through this content item can be processed
            in one of two ways. Choose the option that best fits your use of this content item.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add donation to the cart</strong> - When selected, donations made through
                    this content item are added as an item in the user&#39;s shopping cart. They can then check
                    out and pay for the donation as well as any other items in their cart.</li> 
                <li><strong>Process donation immediately</strong> - When selected, donations can be
                    processed and paid for without using the shopping cart. If this option is selected,
                    then other content items need to be added to the content record, with the proper
                    <strong>Commit sequence</strong>.
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

                <li><strong>None</strong> - The donor can still specify a single amount for a gift, but will not see any option to pay with installment payments. Enable this option if you want your donors to submit full payment for their donation.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed payment options</strong> - Enable this option to provide the ability for donors to choose to pay a donation with a single payment, or make installment payments to fulfill a specific donation amount.</li>
                <br /> <em>Note:</em> <strong>Payment term options</strong> is only available when the <strong>Processing mode</strong> is set to <strong>Process donation immediately</strong>.</br>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="v10only"><b>Gift item</b> -&nbsp; Donations made through your website must be 
            associated with a valid gift item code defined in <em>iMIS</em>. This code can be 
            specified in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Set the gift item by an ItemId URL parameter</b> - Indicates that the 
                    content record containing the Donation Creator will be dynamically populated 
                    based on the value of an ItemId parameter in the URL. If selected, you must pass 
                    a valid distribution code to your Donation Creator content item using a relative link, 
                    absolute link, or navigation item. The URL parameter is <strong>ItemId=[Distribution code]</strong>.
            For example, if you want to create an absolute link to a donation page for the BLDG distribution,
            set the URL to <strong>http://mywebsite.com/donationpage.aspx?ItemId=BLDG</strong>. Or, 
                    if you want to assign that same parameter from the navigation item instead, 
                    enter <b>ItemId=BLDG</b> into the <b>URL Parameters</b> field. </li>
                <li><b>Select a gift item </b>- Specifies a single distribution code to be 
                    used for any donations made from the content item. If selected, this option overrides 
                    the value of <b>ItemId</b> parameters in the URL.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="v100only"><b>Gift Item</b> -&nbsp; Donations made through your website must be 
            associated with the <b>Item Code</b> of a <b>Gift Item</b> (go to <strong>Fundraising &gt; Add gift item</strong>). You can associate donations with the required <b>Item 
            Code</b> in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Set the Gift Item by an ItemId URL parameter</b> - Indicates that the 
                    content record containing the Donation Creator will be dynamically populated 
                    based on the value of an ItemId parameter in the URL. If selected, you must pass 
                    a valid <b>Item Code</b> GUID to your Donation Creator content item using a relative 
                    link, absolute link, or navigation item. To identify the GUID, open your gift 
                    item and copy that URL&#39;s identifying string, such as 
                    &quot;4fe78e06-d0ae-4637-8122-c4e56a92f620&quot;.<ul>
                        <li><em>Absolute link</em>: enter <strong>http://mywebsite.com/donationpage.aspx?ItemId=[GUID]</strong></li>
                        <li><em>Navigation item</em>: 
                    enter <b>ItemId=[GUID]</b> </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Select a Gift Item </b>- Specifies a single <b>Gift Item</b> to be 
                    used for any donations made from the content item. If selected, this option overrides 
                    the value of <b>ItemId</b> parameters in the URL.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commit sequence</strong> - Allows you to explicitly define the execution order of multiple content items in a content record. The number in this field indicates the processing order for this content item, relative to the other content items in the same content record. The value must be <strong>0</strong> or greater. You can leave the default value of <strong>0</strong> if the execution order of content items is not a concern. Content items with a value of <strong>0</strong> are processed after any other content items with a non-zero <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value that are on the same content record.  
            <br>For example, processing a donation immediately requires that multiple content items are defined in a single content record. It does not matter the order in which the content items are defined on the page. In the scenario outlined below, where the Recurring Donation Creator is the first content item displayed on the page and the Submit Order Button Link is the last content item displayed, the <strong>Commit sequence </strong>value controls the order in which the content items are processed. When the donation is submitted from the content record, execution control is given to each content item based on the <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value shown in parentheses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Donation Creator (<strong>2</strong>)</li>
                    <li>Recurring Donation Creator (<strong>3</strong>)</li>
                    <li>Contact Account Creator (<strong>1</strong>)</li>
                    <li>Payment Creator (<strong>5</strong>)</li>
                    <li>Submit Order Button Link (<strong>6</strong>)<br />
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Item added message (Cart mode)</b> - Enter the message to display when a 
            donation is successfully added to a user&#39;s cart. This text is only displayed if 
            the content item&#39;s <b>Processing mode</b> is <b>Add donation to the cart</b>. 
        </li>
        <li class="v10only"><strong>Personalized gift array query</strong> - Specifies a query that generates an array 
            of gift amounts based on the signed-in user&#39;s prior giving history. For example, 
            if a user&#39;s last donation was $50, the gift array shown would be 55, 110, 220, 
            440, and a free text entry field. A sample query has been provided in 
            <em>$/Fundraising/DefaultSystem/Queries/ProductFundraising/GiftArray</em>. If no query is 
            selected, or if an unauthenticated user navigates to the page, the default gift 
            array for the distribution displays (defined in the GIFT_AMOUNT lookup table). 
        </li>
        <li class="v100only"><strong>Personalized gift array query</strong> - This option is planned for a future 
            release.</li>
        <li><strong>Display premiums</strong> - Enable if you want your donors to have the option to select a gift premium.  <br><i>Note: </i>The <strong>Processing mode</strong> must be set to <strong>Process donation immediately</strong> if <strong>Display of premiums</strong> is turned on.<ul>
            <li><strong>Display mode</strong> - Select the mode by which the premiums display is shown.<ul>
                <li><strong>Donor enters gift amount first </strong>- Users will enter the amount of their gift, and then will see a list of eligible premiums for that gift amount. Premiums that require a higher gift amount will not appear.</li>
                <li><strong>Donor chooses premium with associated gift amount </strong>- All premiums appear with their associated gift amounts. When a user selects a premium, that establishes the amount of their gift.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Section title</strong> - Enter desired text to appear at the top of the list of premiums.</li>
            <li><strong>Include option for donor to choose no premium</strong> (<em>only displayed when <strong>Donor enters gift amount first</strong> selected</em>) - When enabled, if the donor’s gift amount is eligible for selecting a premium, they will also see a button to opt out of a premium.<ul>
                <li><strong>No premium title</strong> - Enter the text that will appear for choosing to opt out of a premium.</li>
                <li><strong>No premium description </strong>– Enter any text you want to appear in the area next to the button to opt out.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gift amount label </strong>(<em>only displayed when <strong>Donor chooses premium with associated gift amount</strong> selected</em>) - Enter the text that will appear next to the gift amount associated with each premium</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li class="v10only">By default, the Donation Creator displays a single, empty <strong>
            Gift Amount</strong> field. However, you also have the option to display
            an array of gift amounts from which the user can select, or to display a single
            <strong>Gift Amount </strong>field that is pre-populated with
            a gift amount of your choice.
            To do either of these, first create a <strong>GIFT_AMOUNT</strong> table. In the Advanced Accounting Console, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Membership &gt; Set up tables &gt; Lookup/validation tables</strong>.
            In the <strong>Code</strong> field, enter the distribution code for which you want 
            to customize the display. For example, BLDG. The values you enter in the 
            <strong>Description</strong> field determine what is displayed on the donation webpage:
            <ul>
                <li>To display an array of gift amounts, enter a comma-separated list of gift values 
                    that you want to appear in the list. For example, entering 50,100,200,500 
                    results in a radio list of those values displayed on the page. To preselect an 
                    option, precede the number with an asterisk: 15,*25,75. The gift array always displays an option for the user to select <strong>Other</strong>
                    and enter any amount.</li>
                <li>To display a single <strong>Gift Amount</strong> field with a pre-populated gift amount, enter a 
                    single amount. For example, 25.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If a content record contains several dynamic content items, it is recommended that you turn dynamic page titles off for the entire page in order to limit the title length.</li>
    </ul>
