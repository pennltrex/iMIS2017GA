        <ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
				<li>
					<strong>HMRC Reference</strong> - Specifies your organization's unique HMRC Reference number.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Transactions per Batch</strong> - Specifies the number of transactions 
                    to be included in each batch as the claim is generated. The claim is built in 
                    batches to avoid placing an unnecessary load on the server when generating a 
                    claim for a large database. Reduce this value if you encounter performance 
                    problems.
                    <br />
                    <em>Note</em>: The number of transactions per batch does not limit the number of 
                    transactions that can appear in a claim.<br />
                    <em>Note</em>: If you generate a claim for a large number of transactions, you 
                    may want to adjust the <strong>Transactions per Batch </strong>and <strong>
                    TimeOut </strong>settings to fine tune the performance of the claim 
                    generation. A larger value for <strong>Transactions per Batch </strong>may speed 
                    up the process but potentially at the expense of reducing performance for other 
                    users. If you increase the <strong>Transactions per Batch</strong>, you may need 
                    to also increase the <strong>TimeOut </strong>value to allow the large batches 
                    to complete.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Time-out</strong> - Specifies the time limit in seconds for generating a 
                    new tax claim. If you have timeout issues when processing claims with large 
                    amounts of data, then increase this value and / or reduce the <strong>
                    Transactions per Batch</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
					<strong>Field name</strong> - Specifies items to be included or excluded from 
                    Gift Aid claims. You can select items that are associated with:<ul>
                        <li><strong>Appeal Types </strong>- Lists your iMIS Appeal Codes. We 
                            recommend that you exclude any appeal codes that are associated with donations 
                            where the donor has received some type of  benefit from the gift. For example, 
                            if an event was held and the supporter made a donation at the event, the UK tax 
                            authorities may rule that the supporter had received a benefit (i.e. by 
                            attending the event) and hence the tax could not be recovered. In these 
                            circumstances, an appeal code created for the event should be associated with 
                            the donations received at the event. You could then exclude donations associated 
                            with that appeal code, so that they do not appear in a claim.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cash Accounts</strong> - Lists your iMIS Cash Accounts. Certain types of 
                            payment, such as CAF vouchers and CAF Account payments, must be excluded from a 
                            tax reclaim as they are already tax efficient - i.e. the tax reclaim is managed 
                            by the organisation (e.g. CAF) that issues the voucher. If you accept donations 
                            via such payment methods, you must create cash account codes for them and 
                            exclude these cash account codes from your reclaim to prevent the tax being 
                            reclaimed twice.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Categories</strong> - Lists any custom billing Categories you have set 
                            up in iMIS. Billing Categories only appear in the list if you have enabled the 
                            Use Bill Categories option in iMIS and created categories.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Types</strong> - Lists your iMIS Customer Types. Excluded 
                            customer types do not appear in tax reclaims. For example, you should exclude 
                            customer types that relate to non-individual contacts, such as companies 
                            or charitable trusts. Gift Aid can only be claimed against donations from 
                            individual supporters.
